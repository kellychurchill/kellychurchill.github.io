<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/handheld/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227100019&amp;cid=RSSfeed_IWK_All" target="_blank">http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/handheld/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227100019&amp;cid=RSSfeed_IWK_All</a><br /><br />On  Wednesday, Google introduced the ability to place phone calls to  landlines and cellphones directly from Gmail. In order for the feature  to work, users need to be signed into their Gmail account in a Web  browser. It also requires that users download and install the voice and  video browser plug-in. (This plug-in also lets users conduct video and  voice chats from Gmail.) How does it work?<br /><br />The feature is  somewhat buried in the Gmail chat client, which is to the left of most  users' inboxes. There is a tiny little phone icon. Press it, and a  dialer opens up in the Gmail window. <br /><br />Calls work just fine with a  PC's built-in microphone and speakers. Users can also choose to attach a  headset to their machine to make calls more private. <br /><br />Free to the US - Call phones in the US and Canada for free, low rates for international calls
