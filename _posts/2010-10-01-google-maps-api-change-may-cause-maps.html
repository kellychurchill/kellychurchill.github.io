<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Google appears to have dropped the "maps" subdomain (without notification&nbsp;) so many of our sites that load the maps.google.com api will have  broken Google maps. This would affect any of our sites built with Google Maps API v2. <br /><br />To solve the problem, you can update the url to "google.com" instead of "maps.google.com" or implement the new Google API v3.
