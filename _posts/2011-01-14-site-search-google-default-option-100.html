<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Google site search functionality can be added to any site without the  paid service. The paid service only speeds up the indexing of the site's  content so that when the site search is performed, it returns Google  indexed results. A client can choose to install site search and pay in  terms of time instead of money and wait for Google to index the site to  have their content show up when the site search is performed.
