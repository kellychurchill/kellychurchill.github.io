Mostly common sense but nice compilation of good points for video on e-commerce.<br /><br /><a class="bbc_link" href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/02/web-video-business/" target="_blank">http://mashable.com/2011/06/02/web-video-business/</a><br /><br />1. Video Attracts New, Relevant Search Traffic<br />Today,  ebusinesses that utilize video assets are at an advantage, since Google  is structuring its search engine results to reward sites that include  video<br /><br />2. Video Assets Can be Easily Syndicated<br />By syndicating  video properties to multiple sites — including YouTube, the second  largest search engine today — ebusinesses extend their reach to  innumerable eyeballs. In addition to traditional channels, online video  plays equally well via mobile networks, TV, and in-store screens<br /><br />3. Videos Encourage Sharing<br />Videos are far more likely to be passed and shared than text-based pages.<br /><br />4. Video Engages Site Visitors<br />Video provides a familiar user interface for site visitors<br /><br />5. Video’s “Halo Effect” Drives Conversions<br />Video  can give customers an in-depth view of a product or a demonstration  that quells any hesitancy they might have about purchasing online. <br /><br />6. Video Increases Customer Loyalty<br />Video newsletters are more likely to attract consumer attention. <br /><br />7. Video Creates Online Personalization<br />By  improving and tailoring the customer experience, online retailers in  every sector have increased customer loyalty, conversion rates and  average order price. <br /><br />8. Video Production Costs Are Falling, ROI Is Rising<br />Two  decades ago, the market struggled to replace the labor-intensive  process of website management. Today we hardly think about the steps  required to update or add web content: Images and text are now  template-based, database-driven and easy to manipulate.
