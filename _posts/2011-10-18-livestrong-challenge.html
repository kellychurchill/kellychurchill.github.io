I really enjoyed participating in my first LIVESTRONG Challenge. <br /><br />According  to the LIVESTRONG Foundation, there were just over 4,300 riders,  walkers and runners, and 700 volunteers that participated in the  Challenge this weekend and raised $2.4 million toward the fight against  cancer.<br /><br />I raised over $500 and earned a cool cap.
