A client's site was crashing in IE8 causing the message "This tab has been recovered. A  problem with this webpage caused Internet Explorer to close and reopen  the tab."&nbsp; It turns out there is a bug with jQuery version 1.6.2 having  to do with CSS background images which was the culprit (<a class="bbc_link" href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9823" target="_blank">http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9823</a>)<br /><br />Simply  upgrading to the latest jQuery version solved the problem. Something to  be aware of for other sites using background images and jQuery 1.6.2.
