Noah is working on the second generation of this project. <br /><br />The  first generation is visual representation of data in a "hairball" type  of representation with little or no thought as to what the audience  wants to see in this data. Noah's team is looking at better ways to  represent the data by looking at what are all the questions that our  audience wants answered and then present the data in a way that gets  them there. <br /><br />Noah considers his data visualization work to be a  subset of user experience work and so he must consider the same user  experience principles as any other web interface.
