Seriously. Stop That.</strong><br />A  fine strategy for leaving the office with the feeling that, even on the  most over-booked days, you got at least one real thing done.<br /><br /><strong>Gain Awareness, Be Grateful</strong><br />10  minutes of thinking of everything you're grateful for: in yourself,  among your family and friends, in your career, and the like. After that,  visualize "everything you want in your life as if you had it today."<br /><br /><strong>Do the Big, Shoulder-Sagging Stuff First</strong><br />Based  on Mark Twain's saying that, if you eat a live frog first thing in the  morning, you've got it behind you for the rest of the day, and nothing  else looks so bad.<br /><br /><strong>Ask Yourself If You're Doing What You Want to Do</strong><br />Consider  making an earnest attempt every morning at what the late Apple CEO  Steve Jobs told a graduating class at Stanford to do:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When  I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each  day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It  made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have  looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the  last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"  And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know  I need to change something.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><strong>"Customer Service" (or Your Own Equivalent)</strong><br />Keeping  in touch with contacts from year-ago projects, checking in with  coworkers you donâ€™t regularly interact with, asking questions of  mentors, and just generally handling the human side of work that quickly  gets lost between task list items.
