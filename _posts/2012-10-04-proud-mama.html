My youngest daughter, Rebecca, just completed her Silver Award project  for Girl Scouts. The Silver Award precedes the Gold Award which is the  highest award a Girl Scout can earn. <br /><br />She and 2 of her fellow  Girl Scouts created a DVD aimed at promoting safe driving and their  target audience was young drivers. This project was an extension of  their troop's Bronze Award which they earned in 2009 following the  tragic loss of their Girl Scout leader in an automobile accident shortly  before Christmas 2007. <br /><br />If you would like to see what she did, you can visit their website <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.headsupaustin.org/" target="_blank">http://www.headsupaustin.org</a> and click on the “videos” page. Rebecca also built and manages that  website and their Facebook page. She is hoping to increase the number of  followers to their FB page so if you are so inclined, please Like it!  She posts statistics on there to help promote safe driving.
