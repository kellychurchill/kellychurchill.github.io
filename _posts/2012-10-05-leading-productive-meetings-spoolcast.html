You shouldn't worry about the boss' opinion or your  subordinate's. Everyone should be able to speak up and contribute  equally. <br /><br />Keep  meetings short - most things can be decided in 7-10 minutes. If you  limit the discussion to 7 minutes, it increases the thoughtfulness of  discussion. <strong>[Kelly - reminds me of coming up with a Twitter post  when you have to grab attention in 144 characters or less...]</strong><br /><br />Have a  collaborative meeting space which is different from discussing something  at your desk with someone or in a meeting space. The collaborative  space is void of laptops and computers and instead has collaborative  tools like post-its and white boards.
