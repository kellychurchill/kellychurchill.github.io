He spoke about: <br />1) Responsive design is not (just) a design or development problem;<br />2) The client participation process is broken;<br />3) How to call your client an idiot, to their face.<br /><br />He  purports that the traditional workflow no longer works for a responsive  design process. Static PSDs can't effectively communicate the touch,  feel and "atmosphere" of a website. They can't illustrate web fonts, how  a site will render across different browsers and devices, or animation.  He proposes that we abandon the static visuals and demonstrate  interactive designs made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br /><br />He also  recommends getting the client involved much sooner and much more  regularly in the design process using a controlled feedback approach. <br /><br />There  are some very interesting points raised in this article about how to  eliminate much of the frustration our designers, project managers, and  developers&nbsp; encounter in our projects.
