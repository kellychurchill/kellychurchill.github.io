On my daily commutes, I often see this bus going to and from downtown:<br /><img alt="" class="bbc_img" height="251" src="http://www.abbeywalker.com/images/van2.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br />And when next to it, I noticed "Cirrus Shuttle" on the side. <br /><br />Doing  a bit of research, I learned that Cirrus runs daily shuttles to their  new offices on 6th &amp; West Avenue to remote parking lots. <br /><a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/digital-downtown-a-key-part-of-austins-economic-te/nR72L/" target="_blank">http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/digital-downtown-a-key-part-of-austins-economic-te/nR72L/</a><br /><br />Kudos to Cirrus' great approach to reducing their impact on Austin's awful traffic situation.
