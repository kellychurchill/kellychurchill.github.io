<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
For a project, we needed to present a multilevel product category list and allow full  flexibility for ordering a category both within the current category as  well as to another category or another level. <br /><br />To solve this, we implemented this plugin: <br /><a class="bbc_link" href="http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/" target="_blank">http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/</a><br /><br />Few  modifications were required to integrate it into the existing siteadmin  ordering functionality included &nbsp;mostly around  setting up the categories in the correct format to work with the plugin.
