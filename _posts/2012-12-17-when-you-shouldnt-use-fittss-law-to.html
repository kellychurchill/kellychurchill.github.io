In layman's terms: the closer and larger a target, the  faster it is to click on that target. This is easy to understand, not  too difficult to implement and it doesn’t seem to make much sense to  contradict such a simple and obvious statement.<br /><br />However, before  you start applying Fitts's Law on every single pixel you can find,  consider a few problems that might arise for you as an interaction  designer."<br /><br /><strong>Fitts's Rule Number 1: Create Larger Targets</strong><br /><br />The likely most prominent statement derived from Fitts’s Law is that the larger a target, the faster it is to acquire. <br /><br />This  can be accomplished by utilizing every available pixel to enlarge the  clickable area and thus make it a larger target to click. However,  considerations about available screen real estate must be taken into  consideration. Also, there is a point of diminishing return where the  benefit of increasing the clickable area for a large button 10% is less  beneficial than increasing the clickable area of a small button 10%. <br /><br /><strong>Fitts's Rule Number 2: Minimize Cursor Movement</strong><br /><br />A second statement one can deduce from Fitts's Law is that the closer a target, the faster it is to acquire.<br /><br />This  can be accomplished by placing frequently used buttons close together  reducing the amount of pixels for a cursor to travel. However, doing so  could cause a conflict with other important design principles, such as  the principle of grouping and separating different classes of  functionality or content. Another principle Fitts's Law can interfere  with is the principle of providing a clean and tidy interface. A third,  very important principle that may force you to defy Fitts's Law is the  principle of building forgiving interfaces, which aim to prevent and  minimize the costs of mistakes.&nbsp; The consequences of mistakes are less  severe when the elements represent navigational functionality as opposed  to sharing or editing functionality.<br /><br /><strong>Fitts's Rule Number 3: Avoid Muscular Tension</strong><br /><br />The  goal of Fitts's index of performance (PDF) is to quantify the  information capacity of the human motor system. In other words: it aims  to rank input methods according to the amount of physical effort they  require to execute a certain command.<br /><br />High decision input methods are used to make sure a command is not executed accidentally. <br /><br />A  second reason to implement more awkward input methods is to take  advantage of the space-efficient nature of gestures. According to  Fitts's index of performance, gestures, which involve some degree of  dragging, require a higher muscular tension, which is why Fitts’s Law  favors pointing-and-clicking. However, the advantage of gestures is that  they trigger functionality without requiring UI controls.<br /><br /><strong>Fitts's Rule Number 4: Exploit The Prime Pixels</strong><br /><br />The  concept of prime pixels states that some pixels are faster to acquire  than others. Corners and edges of the screen are especially fast to  access. However, the fastest-to-acquire pixel in any situation is simply  the pixel at the current cursor position, which has lead to the  introduction of the right-click context menu into human–computer  interaction.<br /><br />There are two kinds of context menus: linear menus  and radial or pie menus. The pie menu, although favored by Fitts's Law,  does have a few disadvantages that can outweigh its benefits in certain  situations. One issue is that the circular menu shape quickly leads to  small target areas when more menu entries are added. Circular menus take  up more space.<br /><br />As to the corners and edges of the screen, two  potential problems should be mentioned when working with mouse-operated  devices. On large screens, the amount of pixels the cursor will have to  travel can somewhat offset the aforementioned benefits. Also, Web  designers will not be able to benefit from this rule because their  content (except when in full-screen mode) is run in a browser window. As  a result, they cannot take advantage of the edges of the screen and  will almost necessarily have to opt for a more compact, centered layout.<br /><br /><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br /><br />The  difficulty faced by interaction designers and user experience designers  is that they have to consider, balance and combine measurable and  non-measurable dimensions of user experience to create the best possible  product. Fitts's Law tries to help user interface designers by giving  them easily quantifiable, mathematically accurate values to base their  design decisions on.<br /><br />Of course, it is often possible to measure  the quality of an interface using mathematical values: The fewer clicks  required to access a certain set of data, the faster the navigation. The  more vertical pixels a horizontally aligned interface preserves, the  better it is suited for the respective device orientation. The closer  the most frequently accessed buttons are placed, the more economic the  cursor movement.<br /><br />However, since interfaces are designed for  humans, they also have to be consistent, considerate, inclusive, playful  and discoverable: qualities that can hardly be measured as easily as  clicks or pixels. The stunning accuracy and simplicity of mathematical  formulas may sometimes lead designers to favor the measurable over  not-so-easily-measurable dimensions. And while mathematical formulas  can, indeed, help you enrich user experience, you should treat those  formulas as tools, not as principles.<br /><br />Instead, you should debate  and choose anthropological principles first, and, if they permit it, use  formulas such as Fitts's Law as much as possible to actually improve  user experience.
