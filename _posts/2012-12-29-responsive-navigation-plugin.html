<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I liked this technique when I saw it mentioned in the Adaptive Web Design book that I read (<a class="bbc_link" href="https://theden.wliondev2.com/forum/index.php/topic,9860.msg31816.html#msg31816" target="_blank">https://theden.wliondev2.com/forum/index.php/topic,9860.msg31816.html#msg31816</a>)  and I wanted to implement it on the web app that I built for the Girl  Scouts cookie booth web app I built a couple of years ago so that the  nav would take up less real estate when viewed on a smartphone. <br /><br />I found this nifty lightweight plugin that does the job quite nicely:<br /><br /><a class="bbc_link" href="http://tinynav.viljamis.com/" target="_blank">http://tinynav.viljamis.com/</a><br /><br />TinyNav.js  is a tiny jQuery plugin (443 bytes minified and gzipped) that converts  &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; navigations to a select dropdowns for small  screen. It also automatically selects the current page and adds  selected="selected" for that item.
