I am bursting with pride! My oldest, Katherine, not only got accepted to  Loyola University in New Orleans but was awarded a partial merit based  scholarship!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />She hasn't decided on a major yet and hasn't  made her final decision about whether she will go there but at the  moment, I am relishing in her accomplishments!!<br /><br /><br />
