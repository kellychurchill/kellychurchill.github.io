<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/on-alt-text" target="_blank">http://alistapart.com/blog/post/on-alt-text</a><br /><br />Consider the common bio. For instance, this bio of Faruk Ateş <a class="bbc_link" href="http://alistapart.com/author/farukates" target="_blank">http://alistapart.com/author/farukates</a><br /><br />Among  other elements, it contains an author photo, a page title (an h1  headline containing the author's name), and a paragraph of biographical  content beginning with the author’s name. According to WCAG, it is good  accessibility practice to provide alt text for those who cannot view an  image. But in this case it would be bad, because a blind reader would  have to listen to Faruk's name three times in a row: first, when the  screen reader reads the alt text ("Faruk Ateş"), then when it reads the  h1 title ("Faruk Ateş"), and lastly when it begins reading the  paragraph.<br /><br /><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote tr_bq">As  we crafted our templates, we discovered many places where an alt text  would have been redundant, offering a blind user no new information not  already provided by the page's HTML text, and merely annoying that user  with needless redundancy. Markup is an art, and the soul of that art (as  with all design) consists of creating the best possible experience for  the user.</blockquote>
