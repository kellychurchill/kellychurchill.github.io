Debuted an amazing video of a rocket that not only takes off but LANDS -  one huge step toward making space travel a reality. See it here -  pretty fricking cool:<br /><br /><a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4088932/spacex-reusable-rocket-prototype-grasshopper-leaps-to-new-record" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4088932/spacex-reusable-rocket-prototype-grasshopper-leaps-to-new-record</a><br /><br />Also  talked about being in Texas to go before the legislature to get  permission to build a commercial rocket launch pad near the Texas coast.<br /><br />Discussed  his recent public argument with a New York Times reporter who he claims  made false statements about the reliability of the Tesla electric car<br /><br />Great talk
