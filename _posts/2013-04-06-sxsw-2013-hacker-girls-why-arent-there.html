I ended up in this panel when I couldn't get into the Google Glass panel. I'm glad I did. <br /><br />The  panel discussed the under-representation of women programmers, why that  is and how to change it. There is a growing demand for programmer  talent and girls can fill that need. I had an idea for my daughter's  Girl Scout Gold Award project which came from this discussion. I've  pitched the idea to her... but I'm still awaiting her final decision. &nbsp; &nbsp;
