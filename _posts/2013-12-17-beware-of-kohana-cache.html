<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Quite a few issues have arisen on a project during launch and since that can be attributed to the use of Kohana server caching. <br /><br />This  caching will frustrate a user who is trying to update  something in the CMS admin and because they are always viewing a server  cached version, they never see the updates on the front end. As a  result, caching is turning the page into a static as opposed to a  dynamic one. <br /><br />So, beware of this when working on Kohana sites.  Careful consideration needs to be given to the implementation and use  and benefit of server caching on a case by case basis. The only use that  I personally have identified as benefiting from server caching is a  for a search where the data is not dynamically updated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of  course, if caching is determined to be useful on a site, there needs to  be cache deletion triggered any time the CMS user updates a  record. <br />
