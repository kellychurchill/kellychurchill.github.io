    <p>Change is hard. Often a daunting task, seemingly impossible at times, the rewards for seeing it through are huge. But leading change is something anyone can do. There are no secrets to making change happen, but there are strategies that can help guide the process to give change leaders the best chances for success.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I will explore the challenges of leading change initiatives and truly changing how an organization works. I will be highlighting an initiative that began with a few key players that changed the way an enterprise organization communicates and collaborates. I'll share what was learned in this process and relate it to research from other experts that attendees can do further reading on later.</p>
