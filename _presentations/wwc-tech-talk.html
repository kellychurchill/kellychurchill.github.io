    <p>Accessibility is a word that when spoken causes varied reactions from developers. Many developers realize the importance of creating accessible user interfaces, but given the reality that most websites on the Internet today are not accessible for persons with disabilities, many either fail to try because of the perceived difficulty, or fail because they think that simply adding <alt> tags to the images on their website makes it accessible. While there is more to building accessible websites than using <alt> tags, achieving accessibility becomes much easier when it is addressed at the design phase rather than until just before launch when someone thinks to ask, “is it accessible?” We will talk about some easy ways to incorporate accessibility into your projects from the beginning to avoid the difficult challenges of integrating accessibility into the functionality of an existing website, especially when those sites are being updated in a continuous delivery environment.</p>
