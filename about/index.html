<h1>About</h1>

<div class="headshot"><img src="kelly-churchill-8-small.png"></div>
<p>People call me a native Austinite because having lived in Austin for 12 years, I have lived here 6 times longer than most. </p>
<p>However, my native home is New Orleans and like the city’s reputation for being fun and steeped in tradition, I share in those traits. </p>
<p>Growing up in the South in the time that I did, girls were not encouraged to pursue technical careers so instead I began working as a secretary. However, the call of coding was powerful and I finally answered by earning my degree in Computer Science while at the same time starting a family.</p>
<p>One of my proudest moments was earning my degree knowing my daughters, then ages 6 and 4, were watching me walk across the stage to receive my diploma.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have built my career as a web developer by doing freelance work, working for interactive agencies and am now a software engineer at IBM. At IBM, I manage a team of developers on the Design@IBM core team and promote front-end development best practices as the FED@IBM program lead.</p>
